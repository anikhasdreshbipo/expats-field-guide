# Expat's Field Guide 🌍

Welcome to the **Expat's Field Guide**, a collaborative, open-source repository for cultural adaptation guides for expatriates and travelers.

## Mission
Our mission is to create a practical, crowdsourced collection of cultural adaptation guides for different countries, helping newcomers navigate cultural nuances, communication styles, business etiquette, and social norms.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `guides/` – contains individual country guides
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` – templates for requesting new guides or suggesting updates
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – guidelines for contributing to the project
- `README.md` – this file

Each guide follows a standardized template to ensure consistency and ease of use.
