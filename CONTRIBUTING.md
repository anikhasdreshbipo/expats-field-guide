# Contributing to Expat's Field Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Expat's Field Guide! This project thrives on the collective knowledge and experiences of travelers and expatriates around the world. To ensure a smooth and consistent collaboration, please follow these guidelines.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Propose a New Country Guide
If you'd like to add a guide for a country that isn't yet covered:

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/anikhasdreshbipo/expats-field-guide/issues) tab.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Select the **"Request a New Guide"** template.
4. Fill out the form with the country name and any initial notes.
5. Submit the issue. The maintainers will label it and may assign it to you if you'd like to write the guide.

### 2. Suggest an Update to an Existing Guide
If you notice outdated information, missing details, or have improvements for an existing guide:

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/anikhasdreshbipo/expats-field-guide/issues) tab.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Select the **"Suggest an Update"** template.
4. Specify which guide you're referring to and describe the proposed change.
5. Submit the issue. You can also directly create a pull request with the changes if you prefer.

### 3. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
For both new guides and updates, you can submit a pull request directly:

1. **Fork the repository** (if you haven't already) and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-guide-japan`, `update-brazil-etiquette`).
3. **Make your changes** in the appropriate files. New guides should be placed in the `guides/` directory and follow the `guide_template.md` structure.
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message.
5. **Push your branch** to your fork.
6. **Open a pull request** targeting the `main` branch of this repository.
7. In the PR description, reference any related issue (e.g., `Closes #1` or `Addresses #2`).

## Guide Structure
All country guides must adhere to the template found in `guides/guide_template.md`. This ensures consistency and makes it easier for readers to compare across countries. The template includes the following sections:

- **Country Name**
- **Key Cultural Concepts**
- **Communication Styles (Direct vs. Indirect)**
- **Business & Professional Etiquette**
- **Social Norms & Taboos**
- **Common Phrases (with phonetic guides)**

Feel free to add additional sections if they provide valuable insight, but please keep the core structure intact.

## Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors to respect each other and maintain a welcoming, inclusive environment. Please be constructive and polite in discussions, issue comments, and pull request reviews.

## License
